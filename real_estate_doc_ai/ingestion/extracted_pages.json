The current infrastructure is unable to ful\ufb01l the need \nfor shared, communal and collaborative spaces. The importance of \namenities and the role they play in designing employee experiences is \ngrowing, as 24\u00d77 connectivity results in shrinking employee leisure time.\nStatic workspaces act as an anathema to inspiration and innovation. \nLearning is looked at as an o\ufb00-site experience, rather than a continuous \nprocess in\ufb02uenced and reinforced by company culture through shared \nexperiences.\nOur intention with Max Towers is to blend thoughtful design and \nsuperior hospitality to create an environment, which integrates work \nand life, nurturing a more productive, healthier and happier community.\nExcerpted from Deloitte Review, July 2017 \nExcerpted from CBRE Global Occupier Survey, 2017\nCorporate culture is evolving.\nEmergence of network and \nteam-based organisations\nDeliberate design of \nemployee experiences\nGrowth of digital enterprise\n4\n"
